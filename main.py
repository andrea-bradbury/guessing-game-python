Python Guessing Game

Task: Pick a number in a certain range. Make sure the player knows what that range is.
The user guesses the number. If they guess right, they win. Otherwise, have them try again.
After a number of guess, the player loses. Alternatively, implement a simple scoring algorithm. Because of the simplicity of this game, you could implement a hint.
